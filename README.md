# Supermarket Sales Analysis

## üìå Project Overview
In this project, supermarket sales data is analysed to gain insights into customer purchasing behavior, revenue generation, product line performance, and payment trends. By leveraging visual analytics, the dashboard provides an interactive overview of sales distribution across different factors, enabling data-driven decision-making for business improvements.

## üéØ Objectives
**Revenue & Profit Analysis**: Determine the total revenue and profit for a given period to assess overall business performance.     

**Customer Segmentation Analysis**: Examine sales patterns across different customer groups to identify key demographics driving revenue and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.     

**Product Line Performance**: Evaluate revenue contributions from different product categories to highlight high-performing and underperforming segments.    

**Sales Trends by Hour**: Investigate hourly sales trends to optimize staffing and promotional strategies.    

**Payment Method Preferences**: Understand payment method distribution to enhance transaction efficiency and improve customer experience.    


## üîç Data Description
This dataset captures transactional records from a supermarket, detailing customer purchases across different branches, product lines, payment methods, and other key attributes. Below is a description of the data based on critical business aspects:
### 1. Customer Details
Customers are classified as "Member" or "Normal", indicating loyalty program participation. Gender distribution includes Male and Female, allowing for demographic-based sales analysis.

### 2. Order Details
Each transaction is identified by an Invoice ID and linked to a specific Branch & City (Yangon, Naypyitaw, Mandalay). Orders include details such as Product Line, Unit Price, and Quantity, helping analyze sales performance and profitability.

### 3. Payment Details
Customers use E-wallet, Cash, or Credit Card for transactions, enabling insights into preferred payment methods. Understanding payment trends helps in optimizing financial operations and promotions.

### 4. Customer Satisfaction
Customers provide a rating for each transaction, reflecting their purchase experience. This helps in evaluating overall satisfaction and identifying areas for service improvement.     

This comprehensive analysis of customer, order, payment, and satisfaction data offers valuable insights, supporting data-driven decisions to enhance business strategy and operations. Focusing on these key areas helps improve customer experience, optimize sales performance, and drive sustainable growth.

### 1. Revenue & Profit Overview
The total revenue for the period is 322.97K, with a total profit of 15.38K, resulting in a profit margin of 4.76%. While revenue generation is strong, the relatively low profit margin suggests potential high operational costs, discount-driven sales, or inefficiencies in pricing strategies. Evaluating cost structures and optimizing pricing could improve overall profitability.

### 2. Customer Segmentation & Sales Contribution
Members contribute slightly higher revenue than normal customers, with 50.8% of total revenue (164K) coming from members, while normal customers account for 49.2% (159K). The impact of membership programs on revenue highlights their role in driving repeat purchases and customer retention. Strengthening loyalty incentives could further enhance customer engagement and long-term sales. On the other hand, revenue distribution between Male and Female customers is fairly balanced, with 52.0% (168K) generated by Female customers and 48.0% (155K) by Male customers. This even distribution indicates a broad appeal across demographics. 

### 3. Sales Performance by Product Line
The highest revenue-generating product line is Food and Beverages at 56K, followed closely by Sports and Travel at 55K. Other product lines, such as Electronic Accessories (54K), Fashion Accessories (54k), and Home & Lifestyle (54K), contribute nearly equally, while Health & Beauty (49K, 15.2%) has the lowest revenue share.

### 4. Sales Distribution Across Different Hours   
The chart highlights key sales trends across different hours:        
**Peak Sales:** 7 PM (39.7K revenue) ‚Äì The highest sales period, likely due to after-work shopping. Another surge occurs at 1 PM (34.7K revenue), aligning with lunchtime breaks.        

**Lowest Sales**: 8 PM (23.0K revenue) ‚Äì A sharp decline after the evening peak, possibly due to store closing hours. Other dips occur at 11 AM (26.1K) and 5 PM (24.4K).     

**Trends**:
Stable morning sales (10 AM - 12 PM) around 30K-31K, followed by a midday peak.
Afternoon fluctuations (2 PM - 5 PM) show declining sales before the evening surge.
Evening rush (6 PM - 7 PM) sees the highest revenue before a sharp drop at 8 PM.

### 5. Payment Method Preferences
E-wallets (34.5%) and Credit Cards (34.4%) dominate transactions, while Cash accounts for 31.1% of payments. The strong preference for digital payments reflects a shift toward cashless transactions. This insight is valuable for future financial planning and payment system enhancements.

### 6. Customer Satisfaction Analysis
The average satisfaction rating is 6.97/10, indicating a moderately positive shopping experience. While overall feedback is satisfactory, opportunities exist to improve service quality, product availability, and the checkout experience.

## ‚úÖ Key Recommendations
### 1. Optimize Pricing Strategies
Conduct a competitive pricing analysis to identify price adjustment opportunities. For example, a 5% price increase on best-selling items like Food & Beverages (56K revenue) can boost profit margins without significantly impacting demand.

### 2. Boost Marketing for Underperforming Product Lines
The Health & Beauty category has the lowest revenue (49K), indicating an opportunity for growth. Limited-time discounts such as Buy 1 Get 1 at 50% off on skincare product can be introduced to drive sales.

### 3. Boost Sales During Low-Peak Hours
To address declining sales in low-peak hours, a Double Points Membership Reward can be introduced. Members earn 2X loyalty points for purchases made during off-peak periods (e.g., 11 AM - 12 PM, 4 PM - 5 PM, 8 PM). This strategy encourages members to shop during quieter hours while also incentivizing normal customers to register for membership, ultimately increasing both sales volume and customer retention.               
          
             
           
In conclusion, the supermarket has a strong revenue foundation but must address specific challenges to enhance profitability and customer engagement. By implementing targeted strategies and leveraging sales insights, sustainable growth and improved operational efficiency can be achieved.
