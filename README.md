## ✅ Key Recommendations       
1️⃣ **Optimize Pricing Strategies**         
🔹Conduct a competitive pricing analysis to identify price adjustment opportunities. For example, a **5% price increase** on best-selling items like **Food & Beverages (56K revenue)** can boost profit margins without significantly impacting demand.        

2️⃣ **Boost Marketing for Underperforming Product Lines**        
🔹The **Health & Beauty category has the lowest revenue (49K)**, indicating an opportunity for growth. **Limited-time discounts such as Buy 1 Get 1 at 50% off** on skincare product can be introduced to drive sales.       

3️⃣ **Boost Sales During Low-Peak Hours**       
🔹Introduce **Double Points Membership Rewards** during low-peak hours.         
📌 Example:      
✔ **Members earn 2X loyalty points** for purchases made during off-peak periods (**11 AM - 12 PM, 4 PM - 5 PM, 8 PM**).              
✔ This strategy **encourages members to shop during quieter hours** while also **attracting normal customers to register for membership**, ultimately increasing both sales volume and customer retention.                       
          
             
# 📌 Conclusion                
The supermarket has a solid revenue foundation but must address **low profit margins, underperforming product lines, and off-peak sales challenges**. By implementing **targeted pricing, promotions, and operational strategies**, sustainable growth and improved profitability can be achieved.
